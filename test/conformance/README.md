These test-cases were downloaded manually from the [plutus repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/tree/master/plutus-conformance/test-cases), and marked with the download date.

The top-level `conformance.test.js` file was then created manually.

Some tests have been marked with `_ignore`, because they require comparing partially evaluated terms, and there is no clear specification for that.
